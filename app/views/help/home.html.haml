%h1 Home Page Help

%p
	The
	=link_to "home page", :controller=>:athome, :action=>:index
	shows the most recent measurements from each smartstrip in
	your home. The display will update automatically as long as you have the page open.
	Each smartstrip sends new measurements wirelessly every three seconds or so.
	
%p
	Let one of the uci@home researchers know during your next visit if you would like to
	change the description of a smartstrip location on this page, or change the order
	in which locations are listed.
	
%p
	In case there is no data displayed for one of your smartstrips, refer to the
	=link_to "troubleshooting guide.",:action=>:trouble

%p
	Use the bottom of the page to
	=link_to "record your impressions",:action=>:notes
	and questions about the measurements displayed on the home page or the page
	design itself.
	
%h2 Power Display

%p
	The real-time electric power consumed by each smartstrip is display in two ways: in
	=link_to "Watts",:action=>:units
	and as a projected cost. The projected cost corresponds to continuous usage at the
	present rate for 24 hours, using a nominal energy cost of 10&cent; per kilowatt-hour.
	Let one of the researchers know if you would like to use a different nominal cost
	for your display.

%p
	The right-hand column on your home page shows the actual cost of the energy used
	by each smartstrip over the past 24 hours. The value updates continuously so that,
	for example, at 3:14pm on Thursday it is reporting your actual energy cost since
	3:14pm Wednesday.	When the projected cost is above the actual cost, you are using 
	more power than usual at that location, based on the past 24 hours.

%p
	Actual cost values are based on the power measured by the smartstrip over the 
	preceding 24 hours. In case the smartstrip was not reporting data for some part
	of these 24 hours, the value displayed will be an estimate assuming that data
	that was reported is typical for the whole period.
