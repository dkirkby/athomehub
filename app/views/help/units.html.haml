%h2 Power

%p
	Electric power is usually measured in Watts, named after the Scottish engineer
	whose work on
	steam engines helped to usher in the industrial revolution. Power measures the rate
	at which you are using energy.
	
%p
	Most household electrical circuits provide a maximum of about 1800 Watts to all 
	appliances plugged into the same circuit breaker. Some blow dryers draw almost this
	much on their own, but most of the items you plug in require much less.
	
%p
	Plug in devices often use energy even when they appear to be off or unused. This
	"vampire" standby power is typically in the range of 0.1 to 10 Watts. For example
	the surge suppressor in your smartstrip consumes about 0.2 Watts even when there
	is nothing plugged in to it (use the switch at the end of the smartstrip to turn
	it off completely).

%p
	For comparison, the essential metabolic functions required to keep you alive
	require roughly one hundred Watts. Physical activities such as running can
	increase your energy requirements by several hundred Watts. While you hold
	your hand out on a sunny day, it is receiving about 30 Watts of solar energy.
	
%h2 Energy

%p
	Electric energy is usually measured in Kilowatt-hours. Since power measures the
	rate of energy consumption, using 1000 Watts for one hour or 500 Watts for two hours
	are equivalent ways to consume one Kilowatt-hour (Kilo is the metric prefix for
	one thousand).
	
%p
	Utility companies typically charge about 10&cent; per Kilowatt-hour of residential
	electric energy consumption. The same amount of energy stored as coal costs less
	than 1&cent; but costs hundreds of dollars when stored in AA batteries.
	
%p
	For comparison, a Kilowatt-hour corresponds to about 860 food calories, or one
	bacon double cheeseburger. An extra kilowatt-hour (or cheeseburger) would, in 
	principle, enable you to run two consecutive marathons.
